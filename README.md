# Background Color Changer

## About the Project
"Background Color Changer" is a simple web-based application that allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on colored boxes. Each box represents a different color (Red, Green, Blue, Brown, Purple), and the selected color's name is displayed on the page. The active box is highlighted with a border and a slight scale effect. This project is great for learning JavaScript event delegation, DOM manipulation, and CSS transitions.

## Features
- Change the page's background color by clicking on a colored box.
- Display the selected color's name.
- Highlight the active color box with a border and scale effect.
- Responsive design with flexbox for proper layout on different screen sizes.
- Smooth transitions for visual feedback when selecting colors.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure for the color boxes and text display.
- **CSS3**: Styling with flexbox, transitions, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Event handling and DOM manipulation to update the background color and text.
